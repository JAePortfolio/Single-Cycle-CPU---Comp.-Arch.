# CSC-342/343-Computer Organization/Architecture.
# It consists of all the labs, with a Single Cycle CPU as the last lab.
1. Lab 1
    - Full Adders, Half Adders, Mux's, etc.
2. Lab 2
    - Designed, simulated 32-bit SRAM. Tested on FGPA Quartus II Board.
3. Lab 3
    - Designed, simulated 32-bit bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Shift Left, etc. Tested on FPGA Board.
4. Lab 4
    - Designed, simulated 32-bit Accumulator (Addition/Subtraction), 16-bit Multiplier (32-bit output), 32-bit Divider. Tested on FPGA Board.
5. Lab 5
    - Designed, simulated Single Cycle CPU. Designed Datapath, Control Unit, ALU-Control, ALU Unit, Data Memory.
    - Tested on FPGA Board.
    - Used DRAM/SRAM on FGPA Board to store instructions. 
    - Supports up to 256 locations in Data Memory and Instruction Memory, but can be increased. (Was left as 256 to shorten compile times).
